# IMAGE transformations

“IMAGE transformations” is a template which adds extra abilities to standard IMAGE control:  
- Zoom in and out (with or without mouse wheel)
- Rotate by any angle (with or without mouse wheel)
- Background color
- Context menu (right mouse click)

**It uses only regular Windows API functions, no extra libraries.**

In the demo program (ImageTransform_demo.exe) you can try both zooming and rotation features. Below are the screenshots from the demo:
